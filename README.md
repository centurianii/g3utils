jsutils
=======

Basic javascript utilities that would be valuable in our projects consisting mainly by functions and sometimes small-sized objects.

This is an ongoing repository and things will be added or removed very often.

Testing is still ongoing not even from this container but also from all other <b>js*</b> projects.
